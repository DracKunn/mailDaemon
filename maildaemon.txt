// the aim of the program is to "read" a list of emails, identify key-words, and forward emails based on those key-words. The program should count the number of mails processed per session as well as per day. It should also track how many mails it forwards to each forwarding adress.


// I'll break it down into it's parts first and assemble the parts afterwards.

// 1. selecting an email from the list (by creating a list of objects, each object being an email and it's heading)

The list of emails is a dataset containting:
- The sender's email adress
- the heading text
- the body text

We need to create an array containing objects that each have the sender's email, the heading text and the body text of each email.

// the array should look like this:

var arrray emails[]
var object email{sender, heading, body}

emails = [
    email {
        sender: "sender email adress",
        heading: "heading text body as a string",
        body: "email text body as a string"
        }
]

// 2. selecting the heading text and selecting the body text
//AND
// 3. cutting the text variables into arrays of single word strings (we can use something like .split() to create a list / an array of strings)

define text as a string variables
then add both the heading and the body of the email 
(we could make all the words lowercased to help ourselves later)

var string text
var array words[]

for (i=0, emails[].length, i++){
    text = emails[i].email{heading} + emails[i].email{body};
    words[] = text.split();
}


// 4. comparing the strings in the arrays with the target words for each of the 4 forwarding adresses. 
//  A: "CV" => “recruitment@parkshark.com” 
//  B: “Promo” OR “advertising” => “spam@parkshark.com” 
//  C: “proposal” => “sales@parkshark.com”
//  D: all other cases => “reception@parkshark.com ” 

Now within the first loop we want to create a second loop to check each word in de words[] array. We'll have to define the forwarding function first, but I'll do it in step 5.

for (j=0, words[].length, j++){
    if (words[j] === "CV" OR words[j] === "cv"){
        Forward(emails[i], “recruitment@parkshark.com”);
    } else if (words[j]=== "Promo" OR words[j] === "promo" OR words[j] === "Advertising" OR words[j] === "advertising") {
        Forward(emails[i], “spam@parkshark.com”);
    } else if (words[j] === "Proposal" OR words[j] === "proposal"){
        Forward(emails[i], “sales@parkshark.com”);
    } else {
        Forward(emails[i], “reception@parkshark.com”);
    }
}


// 5. forwarding the email to the correct adress.

var Forward = function(email{}, forwardingAddress){
    send 
}


// 6. Deleting the e-mail.

// 7. counting how many mails are processed in the list as well as over all lists in a day.

// 8. counting how many emails are sent to each adress per list and per day.
